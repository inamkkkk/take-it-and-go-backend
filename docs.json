It serves as the entry point and configuration hub for the backend of the Take iT & Go peer-to-peer delivery platform.\n\n**Purpose:**\nTo manage project dependencies, define scripts for starting and developing the server, and provide essential metadata.\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n- Declares the project's name, version, and a descriptive overview.\n- Specifies the main entry file for the application ('server.js').\n- Defines scripts for common development tasks like starting the server ('start') and running in development mode with hot-reloading ('dev').\n- Lists all production and development dependencies required for the backend to function.\n\n**Key Functions/Sections:**\n- `name`: The identifier for the package.\n- `version`: The current version of the package.\n- `description`: A brief explanation of the project's purpose and features.\n- `main`: The primary JavaScript file to run when the package is executed.\n- `scripts`: Commands that can be executed using `npm` or `yarn`.\n  - `start`: Runs the application in production mode (`node server.js`).\n  - `dev`: Runs the application in development mode with `nodemon` for automatic restarts.\n  - `test`: Placeholder for test execution, currently indicates no tests are defined.\n- `dependencies`: Production dependencies needed for the application to run.\n  - `bcryptjs`: For password hashing.\n  - `cors`: To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.\n  - `dotenv`: To load environment variables from a `.env` file.\n  - `express`: The web application framework for Node.js.\n  - `helmet`: For security middleware to set HTTP headers.\n  - `http-status-codes`: To provide standard HTTP status codes.\n  - `joi`: For object schema description and validation.\n  - `jsonwebtoken`: For creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens.\n  - `mongoose`: MongoDB object modeling tool.\n  - `socket.io`: Real-time, bidirectional event-based communication.\n  - `winston`: A flexible logger for Node.js.\n  - `xss-clean`: To sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks.\n- `devDependencies`: Development dependencies used during the development lifecycle.\n  - `nodemon`: A utility that automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected.\n\n**TODOs:**\n- Implement actual tests in the `scripts.test` section instead of the placeholder message."
